    ^heading Principles of Operation _heading
    ^paragraph
      WRIML is based on several fundamental principles for structuring documents:
    _paragraph
    ^list
      ^item Use of Tags: Opening and closing tags enclose the content of the document, allowing different elements to be delimited.
        ^paragraph
          Example: ^paragraph This is a paragraph _paragraph
      ^item Simplicity of Syntax: The syntax of WRIML is simple and intuitive, with tags represented by specific characters.
        ^paragraph
          Example: ^heading Section Title _heading
      ^item Flexibility: Users can define their own tags and elements according to their specific needs, providing great adaptability.
        ^paragraph
          Example: ^note This is a note _note
      ^item Default Paragraph: Any text not enclosed by a tag is considered a default paragraph, simplifying the writing process.
        ^paragraph
          Example: This is a paragraph without a tag.

    ^heading WRIML Syntax _heading
    ^paragraph
      The syntax of WRIML is simple and intuitive. The main elements to remember are:
    _paragraph
    ^list
      ^item Opening and Closing Tags: Tags are represented by specific characters, such as `^` for opening and `_` for closing.
        ^paragraph
          Example: ^tag Content _tag
      ^item Empty Tags: Empty elements are represented by a combination of opening and closing characters, such as `^_tag`.
        ^paragraph
          Example: ^br _
      ^item Attributes: Attributes are defined using a syntax similar to XML, with the attribute name followed by its value in quotes.
        ^paragraph
          Example: ^link_href="https://www.example.com" Link _link
    _list

    ^heading Additional Notes _heading
    ^paragraph
      Here are some additional notes on using WRIML:
    _paragraph
    ^list
      ^item Flexible Tag Names: Tag names can contain "-" as word separators (e.g., ^tag-name) or use Camel Case convention (e.g., ^TagName).
      ^item Default Comment Tag: The default tag for comments is "-", but users can define their own comment tag according to their preferences (e.g., rem, com, note, comment, etc.).
